Assume your python lib is at /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/torch

run the following commands to replace the two files in this folder:
sudo cp variable.py /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/torch/autograd/
sudo cp tensor.py /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/torch/autograd/_functions/


Notice that instead of revising the gradient of relu, what I did is introducing a new
function called "alphatronrelu", which does the same thing as relu, but has wrong
gradient.
